        <p>
          AFF stands for Airoli Football Front, which is a small federation
          initiated by Airoli City FC in July 2022. We organize tournaments in
          Airoli, ranging from turf events to ground tournaments. Any team can
          participate from any part of the country. Our aim is to ignite change
          in Indian football from humble beginnings and encourage individuals to
          support Indian football. For any sponsorship or donation inquiries,
          please contact us via email.
